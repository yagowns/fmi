          <div class="blocktext"><br><p>How someoneâ€™s racism, being expressed as an opinion, go from a thought to a digital expression, then to a vocal, and finally, to a physical aggression? Is the psychological influences of social media and technology that are placed upon us influencing what we say, and how e say things? How is the massification of communication affecting our conversation with people that we do not agree nor like? Is it helping the world become a more unified and balanced place, or is it drifting towards a speech that was once tolerated, and now condemned, but slowly repeating itself? How fake news in this post-truth era can shift and misinform us towards a confuse and tense future?</p>
          <p>Questioning social media, technology, social relations and mainly who we are as beings that participate in a society, I gathered information and participated in this project with my own biased commentary in the same one-directioned conversation through images, gifs, comments and a UI that does not facilitate the data verification.</p>
